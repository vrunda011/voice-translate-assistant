# Voice Translate Assistant

Voice Translate Assistant is a Python-based voice assistant that allows users to communicate across languages. It listens to speech in one language, translates it into another language, and then speaks the translated text out loud. This tool is ideal for real-time communication and language learning.

## Features
- Converts spoken audio to text using speech recognition.
- Translates text into the target language using Google Translate API.
- Converts translated text back to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- Simple GUI using Tkinter to make the process user-friendly.
